# Portfolio & AI Translator

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my skills as a developer, featuring an AI-powered live translator as the main project.

## Live Translator

### What It Does

The Live Translator is an AI-powered application that:

- Records your voice in any language
- Automatically transcribes what you said
- Translates your speech into your chosen language
- Speaks the translation aloud
- Keeps a history of your conversation

Try asking "Where is the nearest coffee shop?" in any language, and it will translate and speak the answer in your selected target language!

### How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: When you speak into your device's microphone, the app captures your voice and sends it to OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate speech-to-text conversion.

2. **Language Detection**: The app automatically detects which language you're speaking.

3. **Translation**: Your words are translated to your chosen language using Google Cloud's Translation API.

4. **Text-to-Speech**: The translated text is converted back to speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech models, so you can hear how it sounds.

### Technologies Used

This full-stack application showcases my ability to integrate multiple modern technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **APIs**: OpenAI (for speech recognition and text-to-speech), Google Cloud Translation
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Amplify for cloud hosting
- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context
- **Persistence**: Local storage for saving conversations

### What Makes It Special

- **Real-time processing**: Fast, responsive translations
- **Cross-language communication**: Break down language barriers instantly
- **Accessible interface**: Clean, intuitive design
- **Persistent memory**: Conversations are saved between sessions
